# Testssl.sh-JSON-Merger
This quick-n-dirty shell script merges several [testssl.sh](https://github.com/drwetter/testssl.sh) pretty-JSON files to one single JSON file. Useful if utilizing the [testssl2xlsx.py](https://github.com/AresS31/testssl2xlsx) parser for generating a spread sheet, which currently only supports parsing of one single JSON file.

The `testssl.sh` script by drwetter only accepts a single host or IP to scan. Specifying several hosts immediately, with one final export file is not supported. Nevertheless, using some parallelization, one can start the `testssl.sh` script several times and scan multiple hosts. Each output should be stored in the pretty-JSON format if you plan to use the `testssl2xlsx.py` parser.

For each host, you should execute the following command to get all your json files:\
`./testssl.sh --json-pretty <IP>:<PORT>`

If you then want to use the parser [testssl2xlsx.py](https://github.com/AresS31/testssl2xlsx) to generate a nicely formatted spread sheet with all your observations, you'll notice that it only accepts one single JSON file. However, we've got a JSON file for each host we scanned :(

Therefore, we first have to merge all *.json files to a single file that works with the parser! 

Just use my `merge.sh` script :-)

Note: The **/scan** directory contains example *.json files. Replace them with your files.

## Dependancy Installation:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage:
1. Place all your testssl.sh *.json output files into the **/scan** directory
2. Check the path variable of `testssl2xlsx.py` in the `merge.sh` script
3. Execute with `sh merge.sh`
4. You'll find your spread sheet in the **/scan** directory.

Note: Your *.json files are stored in the **/backup_scans** folder.


## Update:
I've added some additional parsing features for the `testssl2xlsx.py` parser. If you use my `testssl2xlsx_v2.py` script, you will get the following additional information in your spread sheet:

- Host vs. Ciphers
- Host vs. CipherTests (currently exports ciphers with < 129 bits; can be changed in the testssl2xlsx_v2.py script)

Note: You may need to adjust the spread sheet cell's height in order to display data correctly.

## Note for scanning several hosts:
You can create a new text file and specify in each line the command to execute for an IP address and port. 
This should look something like this, e.g. `hosts.txt`:
```
/bin/bash /<your_path_to_testssl>/testssl.sh --json-pretty <ip>:<port>
/bin/bash /<your_path_to_testssl>/testssl.sh --json-pretty <ip>:<port>
/bin/bash /<your_path_to_testssl>/testssl.sh --json-pretty <ip>:<port>
```

After that, you can use `parallel` to start all the scans simultaneously:

`parallel < host.txt`
